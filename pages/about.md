# **About Me**

Hi! Thank you for visiting my website. Let me introduce myself. My name is Navaneeth P K. I am a postgraduate in physics from the Central University of Karnataka. I live in Kerala, India. Right now, I am looking forward to my academic career in astrophysics.  

I have always wanted to make a website. Having a personal website can benefit one's career. It's a good place to showcase your skills and interests. I want to put some content on my area of interest. I will be posting mostly about astronomy, science, productivity apps and websites, and programming. This is just a hobby for me, I am not going to put my primary focus on this. This website is made by jekyll and hosted by Github.  

If you want to contact me, I suggest you try mailing me ([npknavaneeth@gmail.com](mailto:npknavaneeth@gmail.com)). I do have accounts on all social media platforms. But most of them are inactive now. I am keeping myself away from social media because of its dark sides like addictive use, privacy abuse, and fake news. I recommend you reflect on your social media consumption and find a healthy relationship with it.
 
<h2>What I'm doind now</h2>
I'm going to update this later!
